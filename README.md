# Clean Code

A lightweight reference of small, focused patterns you can **use while coding in
other repositories**. Use the examples as patterns where guidance for good
clean code can be drawn from.

## Quick links

We currently have guidelines for the following languages/frameworks:

* [![Go](./assets/go.svg) Go guidelines](./go/)
* [![React](./assets/react.svg) React guidelines](./react/)
* [![General](./assets/sparkles.svg) Language-agnostic guidelines](./general/)

## How to use this repo from another codebase

* Locate the target language you are working in and find that folder.
* If you can't find your language, [general/](general/) is a good place to start
  for cross-language patterns.
* Cite the example path you used (e.g., in a PR description) to make provenance clear.

## Scope of this README

* Orientation and navigation only; it intentionally avoids specific clean-code details.
* Development process and contribution info live in [development-guidelines.md](development-guidelines.md).
