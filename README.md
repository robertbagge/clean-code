# Clean Code

A lightweight reference of small, focused patterns you can **use while coding in
other repositories**. Use the examples as patterns where guidance for good
clean code can be drawn from.

## Folder index

- [go/](/go/) – Go-specific examples ready to adapt in Go projects.
- [react/](/react/) – React-specific examples ready to adapt in React projects.
- [general/](/general/) – language-agnostic examples and notes that apply broadly.

## How to use this repo from another codebase

- Locate the target language you are working in and find that folder.
- If you can't find your language, [general/](general/) is a good place to start
  for cross-language patterns.
- Cite the example path you used (e.g., in a PR description) to make provenance clear.

## Scope of this README

- Orientation and navigation only; it intentionally avoids specific clean-code details.
- Development process and contribution info live in [development-guidelines.md](development-guidelines.md).
