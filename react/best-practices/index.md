  coupling.
* [naming.md](./naming.md) — Naming conventions for components, hooks,
  events, booleans, models, and files.
* [props.md](./props.md) — Prop design patterns: data vs behavior, events,
  variants, stability, slots, and dependency injection.
* [testing.md](./testing.md) — Behavior-first tests for components and
  hooks; DI over mocks; Testing Library examples.
* [error-handling.md](./error-handling.md) — Error taxonomy, boundaries,
  policy inversion, logging, and retry guidance.
* [performance.md](./performance.md) — State colocation, memoization, list

  structure, layer definitions, and dependency direction.
* [imports.md](./imports.md) — Import aliases (`@this/*`), barrel exports,
  and ESLint enforcement.
* [relay.md](./relay.md) — Relay GraphQL patterns: fragment colocation,
  container/display split, query naming, and testing.
